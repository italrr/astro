astro
-----

astro is a highly concurrent 3D game engine made with C++11. It's targeted to support Vulkan and OpenGL 4.4+ out of the box. 

astro is meant to be a very demanding but highly efficient 3D engine focused around Open World and Simulation games. Anyone interested in this project will be welcomed.

### Objectives & philosophies applied since day 1:
- Real time 3D Physics
- **Highly concurrent**
- **Major preference for parallel pipelines**
- Client/Server architecture including full network physics simulation
- Open World esque world maps and scenes
- Platform agnostic rendering engine out-of-the-box, aiming to support the following for release version:
    - OpenGL
    - Vulkan
- Multi-platform/OS support:
    - Linux
    - Windows
    - OSX
- Ability to modify any aspect of it through scripts and JSON files
- Native scripting language built-in (Yet to be disclosed which one)


***As of right now this is an experimental and learning project. I will take my time to work on this, slowly adding new features.***
